Internal Utilities
==================

The utilities documented here are all importable directly from
``flatland.util``, and may be useful for implementing custom schema types
and validators using similar semantics to Flatland, or if you're hacking on
Flatland internals yourself.  Typical users, however, need not know about
these utilities.


``flatland.util.base``
----------------------

.. automodule:: flatland.util.base


``flatland.util.deferred``
--------------------------

.. automodule:: flatland.util.deferred
